# Functional Requirements - Digital Asset Management System

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Digital Assets Tokenization

* Support tokenization of physical and financial assets:

  * Real Estate
  * Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
  * Investment Fund Certificates (IFCs)
  * Stablecoins (backed by fiat, commodities, or crypto)
* Each token represents full or partial ownership of the asset.
* Tokenization process includes:

  * Asset identification and valuation
  * Asset custody (if required)
  * Token structure design (fungible / NFT / fractional NFT)
  * Token issuance (mint) through smart contracts
  * Ownership recording on blockchain
  * Token trading and transfer through on-chain mechanisms
* Integration of metadata (IPFS or external storage) attached to tokens
* Support for whitelist/blacklist to ensure only KYC-verified users can interact with specific legal tokens like IFCs and Real Estate

### 1.2 Ownership Management

* Track token ownership on blockchain.
* Support fractional ownership model.
* Verify ownership before transfer.

### 1.3 Trading & Asset Transfer

* Support buying, selling, and transferring tokens through smart contracts.
* Implement atomic delivery vs payment (DvP) mechanism.
* Allow P2P token trading or marketplace trading.

### 1.4 Dividend Distribution

* Smart contract automatic distribution of:

  * Deposit interest
  * Fund dividends
  * Real estate rental income
* Periodic execution (monthly or quarterly).

### 1.5 Regulatory Compliance

* KYC/AML integration for all users.
* Only allow KYC-verified wallets to interact with the system.
* Apply whitelist/blacklist at smart contract level.

### 1.6 Smart Contract Automation

* Automate business operations:

  * Token creation / destruction / transfer
  * Governance voting
  * Periodic reinvestment (SIP)

### 1.7 Reporting & Auditing

* Provide APIs for:

  * Retrieving ownership and transaction history
  * Querying NAV and investment performance
* Track transactions on-chain or hash off-chain data for verification.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Security

* Authentication based on JWT and DID.
* Sign all transactions with Hyperledger Fabric MSP identity.
* Prevent attacks such as:

  * Reentrancy
  * Oracle Manipulation
  * Replay attack

### 2.2 Scalability

* Support multiple asset types simultaneously.
* Microservice-oriented design for easy scaling.
* Prepare for multi-chain deployment capability.

### 2.3 Integration Capability

* Integration with:

  * DID Service for user identification
  * AuthN/AuthZ for access control
  * Hyperledger Fabric Token SDK (via Gateway)
  * Chainlink oracle for NAV and price updates
  * IPFS or MinIO for metadata storage

### 2.4 Compliance & Monitoring

* Log sensitive behaviors and alert anomalies.
* Support periodic reporting in regulatory format.
* Allow audit trail retrieval on demand.

### 2.5 Availability & Reliability

* 24/7 system operation with failover mechanism.
* Support horizontal scaling.
* Regular backups and token state snapshots.
